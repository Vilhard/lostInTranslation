## Lost in Translation App
This app is a single page React web-application that is used to modify translation strings in an API connected to a JSON server. The app uses https://noroff-assignment-api-lit.herokuapp.com/ for storage of user data, which is based on  https://github.com/dewald-els/noroff-assignment-api

## Installation
Clone project, install the dependencies and start the server with npm run start.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sebastian-soderholm/lostintranslation.git
cd lostintranslation
npm i
npm run start
```
Or use it in heroku: https://triviagamevue.herokuapp.com/#/
